# AR-marker-
AR project related to position estimation 


Any suggestion or correction regarding the codes are welcome

Concepts used in the code : 
Calibration : pinhole model [translation vector, rotational vector, distortion coefficient]

Distance from Camera to AR marker : [Euclidean Distance, translation vector, rotational vector, distortion coefficient from calibration]

Distance and Angle between two markers : [Euclidean Distance, Rodriguez formula, tracing angle formula] The angle output is radian
